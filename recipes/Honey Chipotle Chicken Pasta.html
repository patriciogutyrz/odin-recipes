    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wow, let’s talk about fusion! This honey chipotle chicken pasta combines elements of Italian cuisine and Nashville <br>
        hot honey with flavors from south of the border! Inspired by a famous restaurant, making this colorful dish at home lets me <br>
        tweak it to our family’s palate. You can make yours spicier by adding more adobo sauce, if you wish.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 pound penne pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>ice water, as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons adobo sauce (from canned chipotle chilies in adobo)</li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen baby peas, thawed</li>
        <li>cilantro sprigs, for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>1/3 cup corn tortilla chips, for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toss chicken pieces with lemon juice, salt, and black pepper; set aside. </li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until nearly tender and still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes, or about 1 minute less than package directions. Use a slotted spoon to remove the penne from the water and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the boiling pasta water, add asparagus and boil until bright green and tender, 1 to 2 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove asparagus and immediately place into a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. Add asparagus to the same container as the penne.</li>
        <li>While pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil together in a large, nonstick skillet over medium heat, until butter stops sizzling.</li>
        <li>Add chopped red pepper, yellow pepper, and onion, and cook, stirring, until onion begins to turn translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in minced garlic; cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Remove cooked vegetables from the skillet and set aside.</li>
        <li>To the same skillet, add chicken pieces and cook, browning chicken on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in honey, coating all chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Add bell pepper mixture back to the skillet, and stir well. Mix in adobo sauce, heavy cream, and shredded Parmesan cheese. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add cooked penne and asparagus and frozen green peas. Stir well. Heat for 3 to 4 minutes, then remove from heat and allow to stand, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh cilantro and corn tortilla chip pieces, and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
